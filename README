Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries
-----------------------------------

Release version 2.14.0
Project website: www.7kfans.com

This is the release of the Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries source
code as authorized by Enlight by the 7kfans project.  The game is
provided under the terms of the GPL.  See the file "COPYING" for the
details of the license.

This release brings SDL and OpenAL support. The whole 2.14.xx series
should be considered BETA, and even sometimes ALPHA, in terms of
quality.

This version of the game deprecates the I*Magic network library and
DirectPlay.  Building the game will disable the network option by
default.  Renable it at your own risk.


Building the game
---------

General Requirements
* GCC 3.0 or later
* Perl (checked with 5.10.1)

Linux
* SDL 1.2
* OpenAL


We do not (yet?) provide the typical Makefile setup.  To build
execute:
./configure.pl
Followed by:
./build.pl

If GNU Parallel is installed, jobs will automatically execute
in parallel.

If platform detection does not work for you, or you have build
failures, please contact us.


Running
--------
You can download the game data if you do not already have the game
installed. You can find the game data from the 7kfans sourceforge
page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/skfans/

Copy the executable files "7kaa.exe*" from the build directory to
your installed game directory.  Run 7kaa.exe to start the game
instead of the classic enlight version called 7k.exe.  You may
create a short-cut now.
