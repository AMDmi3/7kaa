Thanks to all who made this release possible.


Building the game
---------

General Requirements
* GCC 4.xx or later
* Perl 5.8? or later (checked with 5.10.1)
* SDL 1.2
* SDL_net
* OpenAL


We do not provide the typical Makefile setup. Building in Windows and
Linux may be done in a shell, provided you have GCC (Mingw tested on
Windows) and Perl installed. You will also need the development files
to SDL and OpenAL installed. Once you have met the requirements to 
compiling, build the game by executing the following commands:
in a shell:
perl configure.pl
Followed by:
perl build.pl

If GNU Parallel is installed, jobs will automatically execute
in parallel.

If platform detection does not work for you, or you have build
failures, please contact us.


Running
--------
You can download the game data if you do not already have the game
installed. You can find the game data from the 7kfans sourceforge
page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/skfans/

Copy the executable file "7kaa*" from the src directory to your
installed game directory.  Run the executable to start the game
instead of the classic Enlight version called 7k.exe.  You may
create a short-cut now.
