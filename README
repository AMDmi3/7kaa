Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries
-----------------------------------

Release version 2.13.0

This is the release of the Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries source
code as authorized by Enlight by the 7kfans project.  The game is
provided under the terms of the GPL.  See the file "COPYING" for the
details of the license.

This release brings Linux support for the game through the Wine API.
The game source should remain compatable with Windows as well.  
However, this release is intended as an interim solution for linux
users while the game undergoes an extensive rewrite to make it
truly multiplatform.

This version of the game deprecates the I*Magic network library and
DirectPlay.  Building the game will disable the network option by
default.  Renable it at your own risk.  In the future, the 7kfans
project intends to replace the network code anyhow.

Compilation of the game is provided through the build.pl script.
Please check compile settings in opts.pl for proper setup.

Build Requirements
---------
* gcc 3 or later
* jwasm 2.00
* Wine 1.1.29 or later


Since the game runs on Wine's DDraw, users may find the game runs
rather slow for such an old game.  We cannot correct this issue when
using DDraw, but there are solutions found over at the Wine Project:
